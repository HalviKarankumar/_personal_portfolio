            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Karan Kumar, an enthusiastic MCA student with a strong passion for web development and programming. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and constantly strive to enhance my skills through hands-on learning and experimentation.</p>
            
            <p>Over the past few years, I have developed a solid foundation in various programming languages including Java, Python, JavaScript, and SQL. My journey in the tech world started with web development, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later expanded my expertise into backend technologies such as PHP and Python.</p>

            <p>I have worked on several personal projects, including a <strong>Library Management System</strong> and a <strong>Personal portfolio</strong>. These projects have not only honed my coding skills but also allowed me to develop problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am exploring more advanced web development techniques, focusing on responsive design, user experience (UX), and learning new frameworks. I am also interested in contributing to open-source projects, where I can collaborate with like-minded individuals to create meaningful and impactful solutions.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me solving puzzles, playing chess, or reading the latest tech blogs. My goal is to continuously learn, improve, and contribute to the world of technology, while building a career that allows me to grow as both a developer and a person.</p>
